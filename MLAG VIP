MLAG VIP (Virtual IP) is important for retrieving peer information.

*Note*: The IP address should be  *within the subnet of the management interface*  (mgmt0).

Configure the following on both switches:

```
sx01 (config)# mlag-vip my-mlag-vip-domain ip 10.209.28.200 /24 force
```

Set a virtual system MAC. The System MAC is used to identify the far-end switch used for the LACP System ID. It should be  *unicast*  range.

*Note*: In case of an upgrade the MAC address is auto-calculated. For new MLAG installation, it must be added as configuration.

*Note*: This command is applicable since 3.4.2008 software release and onward. in case you are running older software version, you can ignore it.

```
switch (config)# mlag system-mac 00:00:5E:00:01:5D
```

Enable MLAG globally

```
switch config) # no mlag shutdown
```
